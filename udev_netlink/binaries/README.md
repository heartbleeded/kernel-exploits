# Binary Generation

The binaries were generated by executing 8478.sh 

The binaries must be put in one directory only e.g. /tmp and the file udev must be executed with the value of a PID read from /proc/net/netlink

For the exploit to be application, /sbin/udevd is likely visible in process listing in ps aux
